# Ticket Box System
GET DEVELOPING

1. `pnpm install` in both client and the root folder
2. `pnpm run build-interfaces` to build the type checkers
3. `pnpm run dev` in both of the directories to have either the server or client running
4. `pnpm run test` to run tests

ill have a proper docker and build later i think?
